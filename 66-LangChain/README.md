# LangChain - ain't nobody got time for that?

These are examples I used during the talk about LangChain at the Pykonik Tech Talks #66.
Here's the [video recording](https://youtu.be/PCIU1O_g_L8?t=2160) (from 36:00)

For examples to work you need at least to provide your OpenAPI access token - see
[`.env.sample`](.env.sample), and if you want LangSmith (and have access to it)
then you also need to define other envs from this file, in particular project name
and access token.
